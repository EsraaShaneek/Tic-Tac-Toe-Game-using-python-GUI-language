# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-python-GUI-language
Tic Tac Toe game against a simple artificial intelligence. An artificial intelligence (or AI) is a computer program that can intelligently respond to the player’s moves. This game doesn’t introduce any complicated new concepts. The artificial intelligence that plays Tic Tac Toe is really just a few lines of code.  Two people play Tic Tac Toe with paper and pencil. One player is X and the other player is O. Players take turns placing their X or O. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column or one of the two diagonals, they win. When the board fills up with neither player winning, the game ends in a draw
